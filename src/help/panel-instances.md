## Instances panel

[to finish]

Shows all instances in the font. This includes the Default instance, all Named Instances, and any custom instances that have been made by the user in this session.

Clicking an instance makes it active (green), sets the axes, and repopulates the Glyphs panel with new set for this instance.
\
The Default instance is identified with a home icon.

Named Instances come from the `fvar` table in the font. They are identified with a bookmark icon.

Instances added with the “Add instance” buttons are also shown. They use a sliders icon.

### Export static TTF
Click the down arrow on any instance to export an instantiation of the variable font at the current designspace location. This goes to the Downloads folder.
