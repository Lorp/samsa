## Samsa help system

These files are contextual help documents, that are loaded dynamically by the Samsa-GUI app.

The help files are currently loaded by clicking the ‘i’ icon at the top right of each panel. The filenames of the help files correspond to the DOM `id` of the panel, thus to connect a help file to the “Delta sets” panel, we look at its `id`, which is `panel-tvts`, and therefore load `panel-tvts.md`.

Help files are formatted in a subset of Markdown. Samsa is able to parse this without requiring a real Markdown parser.
