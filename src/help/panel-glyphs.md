## Glyphs panel

The Glyphs panel shows all glyphs in the font, in their native glyph order. By default the glyph names are shown.

### Toggle glyph names and glyph IDs
Click the 123 icon in the title bar of the panel to switch from glyph names to glyph IDs, and back again.

### Navigate to next and previous glyphs
Click the forward or back buttons in the title bar of the panel to move to the next or previous glyphs.

### Play the glyph set
Click the triangular Play button to step through all glyphs in the font, then the square Stop button to stop. This can be useful for capturing the screen, especially as the axis controls and UI modes can be freely adjusted as we step through the glyph set.

### Future improvements

There have been several requests to make the Glyphs panel easier to navigate, for example by displaying the glyphs in “pages” of a smaller number of glyphs, and also by filtering by glyph name. Other suggestions are welcome.
