# Samsa-Core (samsa-core.js)

Samsa-Core is the heart of Samsa, being the library that parses the variations tables of a VF and builds a _SamsaVF_ variable font object in memory.

It is used by the main front-end tool [Samsa-GUI](samsa-gui.md), the command-line tool [Samsa-CLI] and the polyfill demo [Samsa-Polyfill](samsa-polyfill.md).

Notable functions and methods include:

## Build static instance
