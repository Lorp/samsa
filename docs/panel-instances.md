## Instances panel

[to finish]

Shows all instances in the font. For this view, we regard the Default as an instance, and all the Named Instanced from the `fvar` table as instances.

Any instances added with the “add instance” buttons are also shown.

### Export static TTF
Click the down arrow on any instance to export an instantiation of the variable font at the current designspace location. This goes to the Downloads folder.
