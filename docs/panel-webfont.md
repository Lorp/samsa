## Webfont panel

Displays the current font as a normal webfont, that is, with no special handling by Samsa. It therefore uses whatever renderer the browser chooses to use. On macOS, Safari, Chrome and Firefox all use the macOS system renderer.

It can be useful to compare the “webfont” rendering with that of Samsa, to help track bugs in Samsa or indeed bugs in the browser’s renderer.

This panel is editable. Note that for fonts with limited character sets, some or all characters in the default text may render in a fallback font such as Times or Lucida Grande.
